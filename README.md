# rnTheShop

This is a simple shopping app I develop based on an online course I bought. However, it's not copy & paste nor I coded it blindly. The tutorial was instructed with some older version libraries, namely React Navigation 4. Because I'm using the latest version (React Navigation 5), I had to code it differently. It's good experience. I get to learn some best practices from the course too.

# Installation

### Prerequisite

-   NodeJs to use npm command.
-   Expo

1. run npm install
2. run npm start android / ios to launch the app
