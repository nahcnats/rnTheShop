    "description": "This is a simple shopping app I develop based on an online course I bought. However, it's not copy & paste nor I coded it blindly. The tutorial was instructed with some older version libraries, namely React Navigation. Because I'm using the latest version (React Navigation 5), I had to code it differently. It's good experience. I get to learn some best practices from the course too."
